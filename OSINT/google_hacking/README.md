# Google Hacking

**Google Hacking**, also named **Google Dorking**, is a hacker technique that uses Google Search and other Google applications to find security holes in the configuration and computer code that websites are using.

**Google Dorking** could also be used for **OSINT**. \
It involves using advanced operators in the Google search engine to locate specific errors of text within search results.

Devices connected to the Internet can be found.\
A search string such as `inurl:"ViewerFrame?Mode="` will find public web cameras.

Another useful search is following `intitle:index.of` followed by a search keyword.\
This can give a list of files on the servers.\
For example, `intitle:index.of mp3` will give all the MP3 files available on various types of servers.

You can use symbols or words in your search to make your search results more precise.

* Google Search usually ignores punctuation that isn’t part of a search operator.
* Don’t put spaces between the symbol or word and your search term.\
(A search for `site:nytimes.com` will work, but `site: nytimes.com` won’t.)
