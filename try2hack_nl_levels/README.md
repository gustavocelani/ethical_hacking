# Levels Solutions of try2hack Challenges

Welcome to try2hack!

This site provides several security-oriented challenges for your entertainment. It is actually one of the oldest challenge sites still around.

# Rules

Any violations of the above rules are subject to a site ban on your IP or subnet or an immediate kickban by any channel operator.

## General

* Trying to crack (into) anything relating to try2hack beyond the scope of the levels is forbidden.
* On-line brute-forcing, hammering, or otherwise requesting excessive amounts of pages from the server is forbidden. Note that this is thus NOT necessary to complete the levels.

## IRC channels

* Flooding, spamming, channel wide ctcp's or notices and anything else annoying is forbidden (This includes 1337 sp34k).
* Giving solutions to levels, passwords or any sourcecodes is forbidden.
* Giving links to any file relating to the levels on the try2hack site is forbidden.
* Giving links to tools needed for a level is forbidden.
* Querying (private messaging) voices or channel operators without permission is forbidden.
* Any form of ban evasion is forbidden.
* Bans will not be discussed, not in a channel or in a query. Wait for the ban to be unset or you face a permanent ban.
* Asking for ops or voice is useless. If you are 1337 enough and we need someone you'll be asked.

## Try2hack level 10

* For Level 10 see the end of Level 9. The goal of level 10 is to create your own account on the bot and gain +n (owner) by exploiting an intentional bug in the bot.
* Any effort to let the bot crash, die or act erroneously is forbidden.
